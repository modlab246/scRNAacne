# TREM2 macrophages induced by human lipids drive inflammation in an infectious skin disease

## Overview
Acne affects 1 in 10 people globally, resulting in disfigurement. The disease involves excess production of lipids, particularly squalene, increased growth of Cutibacterium acnes, and a host inflammatory response with foamy macrophages. By combining single cell RNA-sequencing and spatial-seq of acne lesions, we identified TREM2 macrophages expressing lipid metabolism and pro-inflammatory gene programs in proximity to hair follicle epithelium expressing squalene oxidase. We established that squalene induced differentiation of TREM2 macrophages, which were unable to kill C. acnes. Notably, squalene inhibited induction of oxidative enzymes and scavenged oxygen free radicals. This work has elucidated the mechanisms by which TREM2 macrophages and unsaturated lipids, like their involvement in atherosclerosis, play a key role in the pathogenesis of acne.  

## Scripts and R data files
We share the scripts and R data files used to generate the figures for the manuscript. <br/>
The codes are implemented in vignettes to show the results of running these scripts. The Vignettes are saved in the "Vignettes" folder as html files. These html files can be downloaded to local computer as viewed as offline websites. <br/>
The R scripts are saved in the "Rscripts" folder.
