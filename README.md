# TREM2 macrophages induced by human lipids drive inflammation in an infectious skin disease

## Overview
Acne affects 1 in 10 people globally, often resulting in disfigurement. The disease involves excess production of lipids, particularly squalene, increased growth of Cutibacterium acnes, and a host inflammatory response with foamy macrophages. By combining single cell and spatial RNA-sequencing as well as ultra-high resolution Seq-Scope analyses of acne lesions, we identified TREM2 macrophages expressing lipid metabolism and pro-inflammatory gene programs in proximity to hair follicle epithelium expressing squalene oxidase. We established that the addition of squalene induced differentiation of TREM2 macrophages, which were unable to kill C. acnes. Notably, the addition of squalene to macrophages inhibited induction of oxidative enzymes and scavenged oxygen free radicals. Previously, TREM2 macrophages have been associated with disorders of lipid metabolism such as atherosclerosis. The present work has elucidated the mechanisms by which TREM2 macrophages and unsaturated lipids, similar to their involvement in atherosclerosis, may contribute to the pathogenesis of acne.
